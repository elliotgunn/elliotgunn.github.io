Years ago, I was learning how to code in fits and starts, and came across this small and ambitious Substack that was just starting out. There's no such thing as too many newsletter subscriptions (tell that to my struggling inbox) so I added one more. 

Whenever I feel hesitant to create or write something because I think, *"There’s probably already a newsletter, book, or article out there about this,"* I remind myself of *Technically*. It thrives in an incredibly crowded space by focusing on being the very best. *Technically* combines technical depth, excellent writing (it practically radiates ease), and humor — a truly unbeatable combination for explaining concepts like:
* [What's Kubernetes?](https://read.technically.dev/p/whats-kubernetes)
* [What does Datadog do?](https://read.technically.dev/p/what-does-datadog-do)
* [What are webhooks?](https://read.technically.dev/p/what-are-webhooks)

Whatever you want to make, there's always room for one more. 

Anyway it has nearly 70,000 subscribers and I nearly fell over my chair the day I saw the email go out with my guest post on data migrations:
