I have a guest post up over at one of my favourite data Substacks, Counting Data: ["Technical writing is too important to leave to language models"](https://www.counting-stuff.com/technical-writing-is-too-important-to-leave-to-language-models)/. I share about why there are no shortcuts to writing something worth reading. Great technical writing has three things:
* Opinions, earned first-hand through direct practice
* Tacit knowledge, codified
* Context, on the broader problem being solved

There's a lengthy list of my favourite technical writers and specific examples to emulate. 

I also found a way to sneak my economic history MSc into my writing about data.
