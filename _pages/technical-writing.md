I have experience in technical writing and working with cross-functional teams to create high-quality blog posts, well-researched longform pieces, and engaging interviews. 

# Specialisation # 
My specialities include: data science, data engineering, machine learning, beginner-intermediate programming concepts, analytics, big data, econometrics, research design, enterprise data tooling, and the modern data infrastructure. 

I have a working knowledge of popular data science tools and libraries including: scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Spark, Dask, Python, SQL, Stata, and end-to-end deployment.
