I help companies develop and execute developer marketing capabilities. I also enjoy working on one-off projects at all levels, whether it's helping turn a student's portfolio piece into something they can be proud of, writing white papers that don't succumb to corporate speak, and crafting interview strategies to draw out genuinely interesting insights. You can learn more about [my technical writing portfolio here](technical-writing.md). 

I'm also an advocate for [writing as a career lever](../_posts/2024-01-07-writing-online.md) and give talks on how students, early career professionals, and those transitioning into tech can network more confidently and effectively by putting some care and thought into their technical writing. If you are the careers team at a bootcamp or school program, get in touch with me at elliotjgunn at gmail.com or on LinkedIn.
