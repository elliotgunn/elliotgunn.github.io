Hi, I'm Elliot
I am a data scientist with a particular interest in big data, statistical programming, and causal machine learning. I'm an LSE drop-out, [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/) drop-in. I’m most passionate about analytical work that is socially impactful and encourages interdisciplinary ways of thinking and working. My specialities include machine learning, analytics, big data (Spark, Dask), econometrics (causal analysis), scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Python, SQL, Stata, and LaTeX. I also have experience in end-to-end machine learning deployment.

I have a background in econometrics and previously worked in research where I wrangled datasets, designed and published quantitative studies in global health. Several projects I was involved in have been published: **_The Lancet_** ([global health funding in Canada](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2818%2930322-2/fulltext)); **_British Medical Journal_** ([FCTC & cigarette consumption](https://www.bmj.com/content/365/bmj.l2231)); **_Global Challenges_** ([overview of systematic reviews](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/gch2.201800019)); **_Canadian Journal of Public Health_** ([global health research funding in Canada](https://link.springer.com/article/10.17269/s41997-019-00247-8?wt_mc=Internal.Event.1.SEM.ArticleAuthorOnlineFirst&utm_source=ArticleAuthorOnlineFirst&utm_medium=email&utm_content=AA_en_06082018&ArticleAuthorOnlineFirst_20191107)); **Canadian Science Policy Centre** ([op-ed on AMR](https://sciencepolicy.ca/news/combating-antimicrobial-resistance-role-international-law)). I co-presented the findings of the CJPH article to CIHR; the analysis was one of the most important inputs influencing CIHR's new framework for action on global health research.

I have also worked in foreign affairs and banking industries, where I developed strong problem-solving and and communication skills working directly with clients. I am interested in combining these skills with data science technologies to better understand and solve business problems.

When not programming, I read widely and enjoy keeping up on the latest research in statistics and data science. I am enthusiastic about international relations, economic policy, and modern art. If you’d like to know more, feel free to get in touch! 

Born and raised in Singapore, I'm currently based in Toronto, Canada. I've lived in Ottawa and London, UK for a bit too.
