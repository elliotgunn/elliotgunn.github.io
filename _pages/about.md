Hi, I’m Elliot! I'm currently completing my MSc. in Economic History at the [London School of Economics & Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/degree-programmes-2023/MSc-Economic-History). Some of my professional interests include: data science, technical writing, data engineering, and statistical methods. 

Before I moved across the Atlantic in late 2022 for a year to learn about the historical miracle that is the [Great Divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Divergence#:~:text=The%20Great%20Divergence%20or%20European,most%20powerful%20and%20wealthy%20world), I worked in tech. I was previously a Sales Engineer at [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) and a Senior Editor at [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/). 

I really enjoy learning new things, working intensively, and producing cross-disciplinary work; I'm always looking for new projects that feature any of these! I currently serve as the Managing Editor at the [International Journal](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/IJX), a peer-reviewed SAGE journal on foreign policy published by the Canadian International Council (CIC) and the Bill Graham Centre for Contemporary International History (CCIH) at the University of Toronto. 

I also freelance as a technical writer specialising in data science, data engineering, and machine learning. My select portfolio, which includes blog posts, interviews, and longform writing, can be accessed [here](https://elliotgunn.github.io/technical-writing). To collaborate, get in touch with me at elliotjgunn at gmail.com or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elliotgunn).

Other things about me:
* Born and raised in Singapore, I moved to Canada for my undergraduate, and I’m currently based in London, U.K., for graduate school. I will be returning home to Canada in 2023. 
* Before tech, I dabbled in global health research. Several projects I was involved in have been published: _The Lancet_ ([global health funding in Canada](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2818%2930322-2/fulltext)); _British Medical Journal_ ([FCTC & cigarette consumption](https://www.bmj.com/content/365/bmj.l2231)); _Global Challenges_ ([overview of systematic reviews](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/gch2.201800019)); _Canadian Journal of Public Health_ ([global health research funding in Canada](https://link.springer.com/article/10.17269/s41997-019-00247-8?wt_mc=Internal.Event.1.SEM.ArticleAuthorOnlineFirst&utm_source=ArticleAuthorOnlineFirst&utm_medium=email&utm_content=AA_en_06082018&ArticleAuthorOnlineFirst_20191107)); _PNAS_ [(international treaties have mostly failed)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2122854119); Canadian Science Policy Centre ([op-ed on AMR](https://sciencepolicy.ca/news/combating-antimicrobial-resistance-role-international-law)).  
* I graduated with an Hons. B.A in Economics from the University of Toronto and did a data science bootcamp with [BloomTech (formerly Lambda School)](https://www.bloomtech.com/). 
* When not programming, I read widely and love economic history, [David Hockney](https://www.google.com/search?q=david+hockney&oq=david+hockney&aqs=chrome.0.35i39j46i131i433i512j46i433i512l2j46i131i433i512j69i65l3.1870j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), and travelling!
